## Documentation

The full documentation can be found here:
<https://findify.readme.io/v3/reference#js-sdk-introduction>

For release notes, see the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Quickstart


### In the Browser

To use the SDK in the browser, simply add the following script tag to your
HTML pages:

```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@findify/sdk@latest/dist/findify-sdk.js></script>
```

### In Node.js

Install the SDK using [npm](http://npmjs.org):

```console
$ npm install --save @findify/sdk
```

or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

```console
$ yarn add @findify/sdk
```

The Findify SDK for JavaScript bundles TypeScript definition files for use in TypeScript projects and to support tools that can read `.d.ts` files.
Our goal is to keep these TypeScript definition files updated with each release for any public api.

## Examples

```javascript
var FindifySDK = require('@findify/sdk');

// First, you need to initialize library:
var client = FindifySDK.init({
  key: 'your_api_key',
  // If you are using this library on a frontend, it will be convenient for you to provide user once on initialization.
  // You can get user object, using `findify-analytics` library, or by manually getting data from cookies:
  user: {
    uid: 'user_id',
    sid: 'session_id'
  }
});

// After library initialized, we can send requests to server with `client` instance. Let's perform autocomplete request:
client.send({
  type: 'autocomplete',
  params: {
    q: 'Red jacket',
    // If you are using this library on server, you will need to deal with multiple users objects.
    // In this case, you need to provide `user` object on each request. If you provided `user` on init, it will be overrided:
    user: {
      uid: 'user_id',
      sid: 'session_id'
    }
   }
}).then(function(response) {
  // `response` variable will contain all response data from server, which could be later provided to the view layer.
});
```

See [examples/](./examples/) for working examples of how the SDK can be used
in a few different environments.

## Versioning

We will try to follow [semver](http://semver.org/) as close as possible.
That means bug fixes will be patch releases (1.0.1 -> 1.0.2), additional
functionality like new endpoints will be minor releases (1.0.1 -> 1.1.0)
and breaking changes to both the library and the API endpoints it hits,
will be major releases (1.0.1 -> 2.0.0).
